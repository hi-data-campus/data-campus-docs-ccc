{% docs ftes %}
Full-time equivalent students (FTES) is a standard statewide workload measure equivalent to 525 hours of student instruction (15 Class hours per week x traditional 35-week academic year = 525). FTES represents neither student headcount nor student enrollment, but it is a conceptual measure of student enrollment. The formula to calculate FTES is expressed by the equation below:

FTES = (Census enrollment X Weekly student contact hours X Term Length Multiplier) / 525

*Example: FTES for a full-term 3 unit class with 40 students enrolled at census*
*(40 students x 3 hours/week x 17.5 weeks/semester) / 525 = 4 FTES*
{% enddocs %}

{% docs ftef %}
Full-time equivalent faculty (FTEF) is generally a faculty member’s full-time load based on 15 lecture contact hours per week. A 3 hour course that meets weekly has an FTEF of 0.2, which is 3/15 or 20% of a full-time load. Combined classes have logic that differs, depending on if "Skip Mtg Pattern & Instr Edit" is enabled. When Skip Mtg Pattern is checked, then the workload is evenly distributed among the combined classed and then divided by the total number of combined classes. When Skip Mtg Pattern is not checked, then each class FTEF is divided by the total number of combined classes.

{% docs wsch %}
An acronym for "Weekly Student Contact Hours." WSCH (pronounced wish) represents the total hours per week a student attends a particular class. WSCH are used to report apportionment attendance and FTES.

WSCH = Census Enrollment X Hours Class meets per week. Hence, a 4 unit class with 25 students = 100 WSCH.

525: The 525 number is derived from the efficiency principle that a "typical" community college class enrolls 35 students.

An example of 525: One instructor teaches one section of a semester-long 3-unit class.
* WSCH: 35 students enrolled in a 3 unit course = 105 WSCH.
* FTEF: 3 units represents 3 FLCs/15 FLC’s = .20 FTEF
* Load calculation of WSCH/FTEF: 105/.20 = 525
{% enddocs %}

{% docs wsch_ftef %}
**WSCH/FTEF (Productivity)**: The ratio of WSCH to FTEF is a measure of workload efficiency for how many WSCH per full time equivalent faculty

*Formula: WSCH/FTEF = (N x WCH)÷FTEF*

*A WSCH/FTEF of 525 for 18 week calendar or 595 for 16 week calendar is considered efficient, providing enough apportionment to pay for instructional costs and college overhead*

**WSCH/FTES (Efficiency)**
In California Community Colleges, the WSCH/FTES (Weekly Student Contact Hours per Full-Time Equivalent Student) is a key metric used to measure the efficiency of instructional programs. It helps in understanding how many student contact hours are being generated per full-time equivalent student. Here's how it works:

1. Weekly Student Contact Hours (WSCH)
WSCH is the total number of contact hours that students are enrolled in per week for a specific course or group of courses. For example, if a course meets for 3 hours a week and has 30 students enrolled, the WSCH would be calculated as:
WSCH = Number of Students x Hours per Week
Example: 30 Students x 3 Hours per Week = 90 WSCH

2. Full-Time Equivalent Student (FTES)
FTES represents the workload of a full-time student, typically defined as 15 units per semester or quarter. To calculate FTES for a term (semester/quarter), you take the total number of student contact hours for all courses and divide by a standard factor (525 hours for semester-based colleges or 780 hours for quarter-based colleges).

3. WSCH/FTES Ratio
The WSCH/FTES ratio is calculated by dividing the total WSCH by the FTES

A higher WSCH/FTES ratio indicates greater instructional efficiency, meaning more contact hours are being generated per full-time equivalent student. This ratio is important for funding and planning purposes, as it helps institutions allocate resources efficiently and measure the productivity of instructional programs.
